_Authoreyes_ (pronounced "authorize") is intended to be a modern, Rails 5 compatible replacement for [Declarative Authorization](https://github.com/stffn/declarative_authorization/).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'authoreyes'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install authoreyes

## Usage

For Rails authorization in Rails versions 4 and below, please use [Declarative Authorization](https://github.com/stffn/declarative_authorization) or one of its forks.

__Warning! This gem is not finished!__

At this point, to use Authoreyes, you must do the following:
  1. Add an `authorization_rules.rb` file.  See the included one for an example.  The syntax is the same as Declarative Authorization, so you can look at their examples too.
  2. Define privileges for every single action you want to be accessed.  As of now, Authoreyes has only one mode: authorize everything.
  3. Done!  Authoreyes will do its job.

If you want to customize authorization behavior, in your ApplicationController override Authoreyes's `redirect_if_unauthorized` before_action and `set_unauthorized_status_code` after_action.  See `lib/authoreyes/helpers/in_controller` for details.

## Customization

### 1. Skip authoreyes or customize authorization behavior on particular controller

Override `redirect_if_unauthorized` in controller you want to customize.

```ruby
class SkipsController < ApplicationController
  # If you want to skip authoreyes and do nothing,
  # just override and do nothing
  def redirect_if_unauthorized
  end
end
```

```ruby
class CustomizationController < ApplicationController
  # You can control whether the role is checked in some conditions
  def redirect_if_unauthorized
    begin
      some_conditions ? permitted_to!(action_name) : nil
    rescue Authoreyes::Authorization::NotAuthorized => e
      session[:request_unauthorized] = true
      Rails.logger.warn "[Authoreyes] #{e}"
      redirect_back fallback_location: root_path,
                    status: :found,
                    alert: 'You are not allowed to do that.'
    end
  end
end
```

### 2. Pass any roles you want

Override `redirect_if_unauthorized` in controller, and you can pass the roles by using `user_roles` option.

```ruby
class RolesController < ApplicationController
  def redirect_if_unauthorized
    begin
      permitted_to! action_name, nil, {user_roles: [:foo, :bar]}
    rescue Authoreyes::Authorization::NotAuthorized => e
      session[:request_unauthorized] = true
      Rails.logger.warn "[Authoreyes] #{e}"
      redirect_back fallback_location: root_path,
                    status: :found,
                    alert: 'You are not allowed to do that.'
    end
  end
end
```
